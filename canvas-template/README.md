## What is SmartMeter?

**Your AI costs are probably 2-3x higher than they need to be.** Most LLM applications blindly route everything to expensive models like GPT-4, even for simple tasks that GPT-3.5 or Claude Haiku could handle.

SmartMeter analyzes your actual OpenClaw usage, identifies where you're overpaying, and generates an optimized routing configuration that saves 40-60% on AI costs—without sacrificing quality.

**Real results:** We reduced our own OpenClaw spend by **48%** by routing routine tasks to cheaper models and reserving premium models for complex work.

### How it works
1. **Analyze** - Processes your OpenClaw logs to understand usage patterns
2. **Identify** - Surfaces cost hotspots by model, task type, and token usage  
3. **Optimize** - Generates a smart `openclaw.json` that routes tasks to the most cost-effective model
4. **Save** - Measurable monthly savings, typically 40-60%
## 👤 Who this is for

SmartMeter is designed for:

- **OpenClaw users** who are experimenting and suddenly see higher-than-expected model costs
- Teams running OpenClaw agents with mixed workloads (quick tasks + deep reasoning tasks)
- Anyone who wants **cost control without killing quality**

Typical situation:

- “I love OpenClaw… but my model bill is climbing.”
- SmartMeter shows what’s driving the spend and suggests a safer routing strategy.

## 🚀 Quick Test (Local Preview)

```bash
# Install a simple HTTP server
npm install -g http-server

# Serve the dashboard
cd /home/claude/smartmeter-canvas-template
http-server -p 8080

# Open in browser
open http://localhost:8080
```

## 📦 Integration with OpenClaw

### Step 1: Deploy to OpenClaw Canvas

```bash
# SmartMeter will copy these files to:
~/.openclaw/canvas/smartmeter/

# Access via OpenClaw gateway:
http://localhost:<openclaw-port>/__openclaw__/canvas/smartmeter/
```

### Step 2: Generate analysis.public.json

```bash
# SmartMeter analyzer creates sanitized public data:
smartmeter analyze

# Output written to:
~/.openclaw/canvas/smartmeter/analysis.public.json
```

### Step 3: Access Dashboard

```bash
# Open in browser - dashboard auto-updates every 5s
open http://localhost:8080/__openclaw__/canvas/smartmeter/
```

## 🔒 Data Privacy

**analysis.public.json** is sanitized for web display:

- ✅ Aggregated statistics
- ✅ Model breakdowns
- ✅ Recommendations
- ❌ No API keys
- ❌ No full file paths
- ❌ No sensitive session data

Full analysis stays in **~/.openclaw/smartmeter/analysis.json** (private).

## 🎨 Styling

The dashboard uses a modern, professional design:

- Clean color palette (green for savings, blue for info)
- Responsive grid layout
- Smooth animations
- Chart.js for interactive visualizations
- Mobile-friendly

Perfect for:

- LinkedIn screenshots
- Client demos
- Team presentations

## 🔧 Customization

### Change Refresh Interval

In `app.js`, modify:

```javascript
refreshInterval = setInterval(async () => {
  await refreshDashboard(true);
}, 5000); // Change 5000 to desired milliseconds
```

### Change Chart Colors

In `app.js`, modify the color arrays:

```javascript
const modelColors = [
  "#16a34a",
  "#3b82f6",
  "#f59e0b",
  "#ef4444",
  "#8b5cf6",
  "#06b6d4",
];
```

### Add Custom Metrics

Edit `analysis.public.json` structure and update rendering logic in `app.js`.

## 📊 Sample Data

The included `analysis.public.json` contains realistic test data:

- 2 days of analysis
- 94 tasks processed
- $60/month current cost
- $31/month optimized cost
- 48% savings potential
